<h4>Background Information</h4>

<p> I am a former US Marine.  I served from 2008 - 2011.  In 2009 I was deployed to Iraq.  Since earning a Honorable Discharge from the Marine Corps I returned to my hometown of Cheney and Spokane Washington.  Immediately returned to Eastern Washington University to get my BA under the Post 9-11 GI Bill.  Haven&#39;t even taken a summer off since going back to school either.  I also have my own business licensed in Washington State called Infused Media.  This focuses right now on Photography and Graphic Design with the intention of focusing on Web Design as well in the future.</p>

<h4>Professional Objectives</h4>

<p>My goal is to be a successful Graphic Designer that will be recognized through out the community.  I want to produce work that will display a honest and effective message to the community.  Other professional goals that I have is to work for a company that will stand by their ethics that they have and not adhere to what they do not believe in.  If this can not be accomplished then I will look at starting up my own business.  </p>
